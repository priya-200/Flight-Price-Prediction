<h1>✈️ Flight Price Prediction: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering</h1>
    
    <p>
        This repository contains the <strong>data cleaning</strong> 🧹 and <strong>feature engineering</strong> ⚙️ steps for the <strong>Flight Price Prediction</strong> project. 
        The goal of this project was to preprocess and prepare the data for machine learning models to predict flight prices. 
        <br> 
        While this project focuses on transforming the raw data into a clean and feature-rich dataset, it does <em>not</em> include model building or price prediction.
    </p>

    <h2>🌟 Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset used in this project contains flight information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>📍 <strong>Flight Source</strong></li>
        <li>📍 <strong>Flight Destination</strong></li>
        <li>🛑 <strong>Total Stops</strong></li>
        <li>💰 <strong>Flight Price</strong></li>
        <li>📝 Other relevant flight details (e.g., date, airline, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The project includes the following key steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>🧹 <strong>Data Cleaning</strong>: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.</li>
        <li>⚙️ <strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The resulting preprocessed data is ready for machine learning models to predict flight prices! 🚀
    </p>

    <h2>📋 Steps Performed</h2>
    <h3>1️⃣ Data Loading</h3>
    <p>✔️ The dataset was loaded from a CSV file and examined for inconsistencies, such as missing values and incorrect data types.</p>
    
    <h3>2️⃣ Data Cleaning</h3>
    <p>
        🧹 Steps included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔍 Identifying and handling missing values.</li>
        <li>🔢 Converting categorical and numerical columns to appropriate data types.</li>
        <li>❌ Removing duplicate entries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3️⃣ Feature Engineering</h3>
    <p>
        ⚙️ New features were created to enhance the dataset, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>🗓️ Extracting date, month, and day of the week from flight date columns.</li>
        <li>🛑 Encoding <strong>Total Stops</strong> as numerical categories.</li>
        <li>📊 Using <strong>OneHotEncoding</strong> and <strong>OrdinalEncoding</strong> for categorical variables.</li>
        <li>📈 Scaling numerical features for consistency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📂 Dataset</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset used in this project can be found in the <code>data/</code> directory. It contains raw flight data before cleaning and the final preprocessed dataset ready for machine learning tasks.
